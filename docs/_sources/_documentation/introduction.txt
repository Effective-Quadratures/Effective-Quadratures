Introduction
************

Overview
========
Effective Quadratures is a Python-based library that supports a wide range of utilities in *uncertainty quantification*, *dimension reduction*, *sensitivity analysis* and *optimisation*---all using polynomials. The project was initially born out of a need to replicate the results of various works within the field of polynomial chaos. It has subsequently morphed into a dedicated effort to use polynomials for a range of objectives under the broad umbrella of **supervised machine learning**. 

The project is under active development with new techniques within the fields indicated above. The primary developers are academics at the `University of Cambridge <http://www.cam.ac.uk>`__.

Quick start
============
>>> from equadratures import *
>>> import numpy as np

Math
====

This is a test. Here is an equation:
:math:`X_{0:5} = (X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)`.
Here is another:

.. math::
    :label: This is a label

    \nabla^2 f =
    \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}
    \left( \sin \theta \, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}

You can add a link to equations like the one above :eq:`This is a label` by using ``:eq:``.
