class Sampling:

    """
    Definition of a sampling object
    A unified interface for generation
    of quadrature sampling points

    Parameters
    ----------

    parameters : list
        A list of parameters,
        each element of the list is
        an instance of the Parameter class.

    basis : Basis
        An instance of the Basis class
        corresponding to the multi-index set used.

    samples : A Tuple of (String, Dict)
        The first argument to this input specifies the sampling strategy.
        Avaliable options are:
            - 'monte-carlo'
            - 'latin-hypercube'
            - 'induced-sampling'
            - 'christoffel-sampling'
            - 'sparse-grid'
            - 'tensor-grid'
            - 'user-defined'

        The second argument to this input is a dictionary,
        that naturally depends on the chosen string.

        Note that:
            - 'monte-carlo',
            - latin-hypercube'
            - 'induced-sampling'
            - 'christoffel-sampling'
        are random sampling techniques
        thus their output will vary with each instance;
        initialization of a random seed is recommended to facilitate reproducibility.
        All these four techniques and 'tensor-grid' have a similar dict structure,
        that comprises of the fields:

            sampling-ratio : double
                The ratio of the number of samples
                to the number of coefficients (cardinality of the basis).
                Should be greater than 1.0 for 'least-squares'.

            subsampling-optimisation: String

                The type of subsampling required.
                In the aforementioned four sampling strategies,
                we generate a logarithm factor of samples above the required amount
                and prune down the samples using an optimisation technique.

                Avaliable options include:
                    - 'qr'
                    - 'lu'
                    - 'svd'
                    - 'newton'

        There is a separate dictionary structure for
            - 'sparse-grid';
        the dictionary has the form:

            growth-rule : string
                Two growth rules are avaliable:
                    - 'linear'
                    - 'exponential'
                The growth rule specifies
                the relative increase in points
                when going from one level to another

            level : int
                the maximum degree of exactness
                associated with the quadrature rule.

        For the argument
            - 'user-defined'
        There are two inputs in the dictionary:

            quadrature-points : numpy ndarray
                The shape of this array will have size:
                (number of observations, dimensions).
