**What is Effective Quadratures?**
Effective Quadratures is a suite of tools for generating polynomials for approximation, uncertainty quantification (UQ), optimization and integration.  

**Why do we need it?**
* To replicate and compare state-of-the-art techniques and results in UQ;
* To facilitate easy programming of new techniques at a research level;
* To have a unified, easy-to-use platform with interactive demos---tailored for industrial use.

**So, what's new in Effective Quadratures?**
* New sampling & integration routines for more efficienct use of your model evaluations;
* Techniques that leverage adjoint (gradient) information;
* Plotting subroutines for quick, one-command plots.

# Installation
For installation on Mac and Linux systems, simply type the following into the terminal. 
```bash
> sudo python setup.py install
```
For installation on Windows, you will need [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows); select the Python 2.7 option. Upon successful installation, open the Sypder IDE and go into the Effective-Quadratures-master directory and type the following in the command window
```bash
> python setup.py install
```
This should build the code. Just make sure you include the location of effective_quadratures folder to your python file and you should be good to go. To run this code you will require python 2.7, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. 

# Simple example of use
Below we a simple example that shows some of the functionality in Effective Quadratures. Here we demonstrate how to construct a bi-variate quadrature rule (using a tensor grid) from two different distriutions. 
```python
from equadratures import *

x = Parameter(param_type='Gaussian', shape_parameter_A=3.0, shape_parameter_B=2.0, points=6)
y = Parameter(param_type='Weibull', shape_parameter_A=1.0, shape_parameter_B=2.2, points=4)

p = Polyint([x,y])
points, weights = p.getPointsAndWeights()
print points
